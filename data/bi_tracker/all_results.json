The linked percentage is perfect at 100%, contributing significantly to the score. The evidence quality is moderate, with only half of the entries providing evidence, which lowers the score. The recency aspect is not fully addressed, as there are no recent meeting references provided. Overall, the combination of these factors results in a score of 0.73.",
