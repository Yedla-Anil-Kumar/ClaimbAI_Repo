    "recommendations": "### Top Risks\n\n1. **Lack of Documentation:** With a docstring coverage of only 20.6%, the codebase lacks sufficient documentation, making it hard for new developers to understand the code and for current developers to maintain it.\n\n2. **Poor Maintainability:** An average maintainability index of 0 indicates that the code is likely difficult to maintain, which can lead to increased technical debt over time.\n\n3. **Secret Management:** The presence of 26 secret files suggests potential security vulnerabilities, as sensitive information could be exposed if not handled properly.\n\n4. **Test Coverage Gaps:** Although tests exist, the absence of a test coverage report raises concerns about inadequate testing, potentially leading to untested or poorly tested code paths.\n\n5. **Absence of Dependencies Specification:** The lack of requirements and pipfile indicates potential issues with dependency management, making it challenging to reproduce the environment consistently.\n\n### Actionable Improvements\n\n1. **Enhance Documentation:**\n   - Initiate a documentation review process to increase docstring coverage to at least 80% in the next sprint. Consider adopting tools like Sphinx for automation.\n\n2. **Increase Maintainability:**\n   - Refactor complex functions to reduce cyclomatic complexity. Aim for a target of under 10 by breaking down larger functions over the next two iterations.\n\n3. **Implement Secret Management:**\n   - Introduce a secret management solution (e.g., Vault or AWS Secrets Manager) to manage sensitive files securely and prevent hard-coding secrets into the codebase.\n\n4. **Establish Test Coverage Reporting:**\n   - Integrate a test coverage tool (e.g., coverage.py) into the CI pipeline and aim for a minimum of 75% test coverage over the following development cycle.\n\n5. **Create Environment Configuration Files:**\n   - Generate a requirements.txt or a Pipfile and an environment.yml to standardize dependencies. This should be a priority for the next release to ensure easier setup for new developers."

    "recommendations": "### Top Risks\n\n1. **Maintainability Issues**: An average maintainability index of 0 indicates that the code is potentially not maintainable, leading to increased technical debt and difficulty in making future changes.\n   \n2. **Lack of Testing**: No tests are present. Without a test suite, there is a high risk of undetected bugs and decreased reliability of the application when modifications are made.\n\n3. **Documentation Deficiency**: The absence of docstring coverage signals poor code documentation, making it difficult for new developers to understand and work with the codebase.\n\n4. **CI/CD Gaps**: No CI workflow or deployment scripts in place mean that integration and deployment processes could be error-prone and not repeatable, increasing the risk of major issues in production.\n\n5. **Framework Utilization**: No frameworks (like sklearn, TensorFlow, etc.) are being utilized. This limits leveraging existing solutions, potentially leading to redundant code and inefficiencies.\n\n### Recommended Improvements\n\n1. **Implement Basic Testing**: Implement a test suite using a framework (e.g., pytest or unittest) to establish a baseline of automated tests covering critical functionalities.\n\n2. **Enhance Documentation**: Start adding docstrings and comments in the codebase to improve overall documentation and maintainability. Aim for at least 80% coverage of modules.\n\n3. **Establish CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a basic CI workflow using services like GitHub Actions or Travis CI, enabling automated testing and build processes to catch issues early.\n\n4. **Integrate Requirement Files**: Create and maintain a `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` for package management. This ensures that all necessary dependencies are tracked and consistent across environments.\n\n5. **Adopt Frameworks**: Introduce commonly used frameworks relevant to your domain (like TensorFlow or sklearn) to enhance functionality, improve efficiency, and streamline the development process. \n\nBy taking these actionable steps, you will significantly reduce the risks outlined and enhance the overall quality and readiness of the project."
