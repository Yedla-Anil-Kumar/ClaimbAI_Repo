    "recommendations": "### Top Risks\n\n1. **Lack of Testing**: No tests or test coverage reports exist, leading to potential undetected bugs and lower reliability.\n2. **Poor Documentation**: With zero docstring coverage and minimal README information, understanding and maintaining the code become challenging.\n3. **Secrets Management**: Presence of a secret file raises security risks if sensitive information is exposed or mishandled.\n4. **Low Maintainability**: An average maintainability index of 0.0 suggests the codebase is hard to maintain or modify effectively.\n5. **No Continuous Integration (CI)**: Absence of CI workflows means changes may not be validated automatically, increasing integration risks.\n\n### Actionable Improvements\n\n1. **Implement Testing Framework**: Introduce a testing framework (e.g., pytest) and create unit tests to ensure code reliability. Aim for at least 80% test coverage.\n2. **Establish CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a CI workflow using platforms like GitHub Actions or Travis CI to automatically run tests on pull requests.\n3. **Enhance Documentation**: Start with documenting existing code using docstrings and improve the README with comprehensive installation/run instructions and project overview.\n4. **Secure Secrets Management**: Replace or remove any sensitive information in the repo. Consider using environment variables or secret management tools (e.g., Vault).\n5. **Refactor for Maintainability**: Evaluate the code for complexity and start refactoring sections with high cyclomatic complexity and potential for improvement in clarity. Aim for a complexity average below 2."

    "recommendations": "### Top Risks\n\n1. **Low Maintainability**: The maintainability index is zero, indicating code is likely hard to read, understand, and modify. This increases the risk of defects and makes onboarding new team members challenging.\n  \n2. **Insufficient Documentation**: Only 20.6% docstring coverage means that the code may be poorly documented, hindering collaboration and maintainability.\n  \n3. **Lack of Test Coverage Report**: While tests exist, the absence of a coverage report raises concerns about the adequacy and reliability of the tests.\n\n4. **Presence of Secrets in Codebase**: The existence of 26 secret files poses a security risk, which could lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.\n\n5. **Development Maturity**: The relatively low score (2.2) indicates that the engineering practices may not be fully optimized, impacting overall team performance and project success.\n\n### Actionable Improvements\n\n1. **Improve Maintainability**:\n   - **Refactor High Complexity Areas**: Reduce cyclomatic complexity by breaking large functions into smaller, manageable pieces. Aim for complexity scores below 5 to enhance readability and maintainability.\n\n2. **Enhance Documentation**:\n   - **Implement Docstring Standards**: Increase docstring coverage to at least 80%. Utilize tools like Sphinx to generate documentation automatically from docstrings.\n\n3. **Establish Testing Metrics**:\n   - **Introduce Test Coverage Reporting**: Integrate a coverage tool like `coverage.py` to assess the testing completeness and ensure critical paths are tested.\n\n4. **Manage Secrets**:\n   - **Implement Secret Management**: Use tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage sensitive information, replacing hardcoded secrets.\n  \n5. **Standardize Development Practices**:\n   - **Create and Enforce Coding Guidelines**: Implement code review processes and enforce best practices through style guides, leading to improved development maturity and consistency."
